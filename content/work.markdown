I work as a developer at Redbox Digital, a London based
Magento agency. Some very clever, and very nice people work there,
and I doubt that I could be much happier.

For work, I tend to do a bit of front end styling, small amounts of
Magento development, and some JavaScript on the side. I will be
forever grateful for them putting up with my crap.
