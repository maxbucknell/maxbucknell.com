I am currently pursuing a mathematics degree at the
University of York, UK. I'm in my second year, and so far,
it's going very well.

I think I will head down the applied mathematics route, specifically
fluid dynamics. Like all of mathematics, it's rich, interesting and
has a wonderful history, with some real masters to study. But it
also has a great deal of relevance, as well as interesting things to
do in the real world and some pretty tight links with other things
that I like.
