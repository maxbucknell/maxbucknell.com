In more than one way, I am a curious person. I like to think
about things, and write about what I think. Sometimes that's words,
sometimes it's code, and sometimes it's mathematics, or (usually)
some combination thereof.

I like to start projects, to scratch some kind of itch, or to learn
something that I don't understand. Right now, I'm making this
website for myself, using a few tools that seem interesting to me.
I'm also writing a JavaScript library to do algebra, because I don't
like how magical WolframAlpha et al seem to me. It's turning out
to be an interesting exercise in analysing how I think about
problems.

Most of the time, I can be found in a small house in York, where I
live with my girlfriend.
