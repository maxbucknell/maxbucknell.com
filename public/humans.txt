This is my website
==================

This is my website, the same way Rome was Caesar's. Two things to note:

  |
  | Websites, like empires, are not made in a day. This is still very much a work
  | in progress. Regard it as such.
  |
  | Websites, like empires, are not made by one person. Many people and tools
  | contributed to this existing, and all are (I believe) fully credited herein.
  |

## This is my technical stack.

Here's a list of the technology I've used

+ centos 6
+ git (and github)
+ nginx
+ stunnel
+ varnish
+ node.js

+ grunt
+ express
+ lo-dash
+ sass
+ bourbon
+ neat
+ bitters

+ jquery
+ lodash
+ labjs
+ jakesgordon/javascript-state-machine

I would also like to thank my friend, Chris, my girlfriend, Eliza, my colleagues
Angels, Bolaji, John, Mary, Mat, Sam and Steve for letting me bounce ideas
around with them. I wouldn't be doing this without them. You guys rock.

And, thank you for looking at the human side of a website. Keep doing that,
because things are worthless unless we ascribe worth. By definition, you are
making what we do valuable, and I appreciate that.

Best wishes,
Max.
